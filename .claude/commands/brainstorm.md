# Brainstorm

Discuss the approach before implementation.

## What to Do

1. Clarify requirements - ask questions
2. Present 2-3 options with trade-offs
3. Recommend one approach
4. Get user approval before coding

## Example Output

```
Before implementing, let me understand:
- What's the scope?
- Any constraints?
- Preferred approach?

Options I see:

1. [Option A] - Simple, fast to build
   Pros: Quick, less complexity
   Cons: Limited flexibility

2. [Option B] - More robust
   Pros: Scales better, more maintainable
   Cons: More setup time

Recommendation: [Option] because [reasoning]

Does this make sense? Any concerns?
```

## When to Use

- New features
- Architecture decisions
- Multiple valid approaches
- Unclear requirements
